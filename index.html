          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

          <p>As a queer, non-binary, incoming Junior Developer, my career (and half a life-time) in the arts, in tandem with my history in the service industry has provided me with an empathetic, critical optimism as well as a creative love for problem-solving in community spaces with a vulnerable and open spirit.</p>
          <p> I can't wait to meet you!</p>

            <h2>Who's That Guy?!</h2>
            <p>The Trivia Game for everytime you've seen an actor and wondered aloud, "Wait, who's that guy again?"</p>
            <p>Join the fun with this interactive quiz game that endulges that deepest itch of not quite being able to put your finger on where you've seen that guy before. This time, with Star Trek characters! Some of these roles are one off cameos, some are recurring characters, but they all have one thing in common: You've seen that freaking guy before, what's his name again?</p>

            <h2>Gross, I Love It!</h2>
            <p>It's a movie collector! It's a game! It's a trip down the rabbit hole of horrible movies!</p>
            <p>Netflix, Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes. They all try to point us in the direction of quality cinema that is worth your hard-earned dollars and time. But what aren't they showing you? Yeah, I ranked that Sci-Fi B movie "2 Stars", but that dosen't mean I don't want to see movies like that on my feed! "Gross, I Love It!"" to the rescue! A fun, movie-collection app that only allows the worst of the worst from the archives over at The MovieDB!</p>
